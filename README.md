# vue-todo-vuex

This ToDo App is a continuation of the vue-todo-app. It functions similarly as the first project, except it uses vuex, Vue's state management library to allow the components to access and manipulate state from a centralized store.

To create this application, I followed the tutorial created by Traversy Media: https://youtu.be/5lVQgZzLMHc.

The basic function of this application are as follows:

- Add a ToDo item
- Delete a ToDo item
- Filter the number of ToDos on the page
- Double-Click ToDo item to mark as completed

This app was created using the 'vue create' command in the command line. It uses Vuex to manage state, async/await promise syntax, JSONplaceholder for sample json data, and vue router plugin to make navigating the single page app a breeze.
